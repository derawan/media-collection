This application was build in two seperate project
- First Part (backend API) using  .NET Core Net Framework 6.0, SQL Server Entity Framework Code First
- Second Part (client) using React JS, bootstrap


After you have clone the project make sure you update the dependencies of both the project
you can run both as a 2 server one for the backend and the other for the client

other alternative, on client / react build the project first
then copy what's inside build folder into backend source on www folder
then start the application for example
   http://localhost:7142/index.html
